I am a M.S.E Student in [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/), Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University.
My primary research interests are in the application of computing (AI, data science and visualization) to problems relevant to medicine.
 I have published more than 5 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iShvJlEAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FJerry391%2FJerry391.github.io%40google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
