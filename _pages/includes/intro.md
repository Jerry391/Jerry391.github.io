I am currently a data analyst at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Gregory D. Kirk](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1507/gregory-d-kirk) and [Jing Sun](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3744/jing-sun). I received my M.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Hongkai Ji](https://jilab.org/people/) and [Weiqiang Zhou](http://www.weiqiangzhou.com/aboutme/). Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from Nanjing Normal University, advised by [Yanhui Gu](http://schools.njnu.edu.cn/computer/person/yanhui-gu).

My research interests lie in AI for Science, particularly in biology and medicine. Currently, I mainly focus on deep learning for large-scale genomic data representation. I also develop computational models to tackle biomedical challenges and drive progress in human healthcare. 
In the past, I have collaborated with [Richen Liu](https://dabigtou.github.io/richenliu/) at NJNU, [Weihua Pan](https://agis.caas.cn/en/research/principalinvestigator/253198.htm) at CAAS, [Robert Stevens](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/robert-david-stevens/2702555), [Kai Ding](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/kai-ding/2777666), [Junyu Chen](https://junyuchen.me/) at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes.
